# Project-Explore-US-Bikeshare-Data
•	Utilized NumPy and Pandas on Python to perform exploratory data analysis on the data from a bike-sharing company for three major cities in the United States—Chicago, New York City, and Washington. 

•	Wrote Python code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics and taking in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics. 

•	Obtained useful insights, such as that bikes were most popular at 5 PM on weekdays and Tuesday was the most common day of the week in Chicago.
